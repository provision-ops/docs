# Getting Started

## Getting Started

The prerequisites for Provision are:

* PHP-CLI.
* Composer.
* A web & database server _or_ Docker and `docker-compose` \(Docker v17.05 or higher\).

Since we are still early in development, we recommend installing from source repository at [https://github.com/provision4/provision](https://github.com/provision4/provision).

```
$ git clone git@github.com:provision4/provision.git ~/Projects/provision4
$ cd ~/Projects/provision
$ composer install
$ sudo ln -s $PWD/bin/provision /usr/local/bin/provision
$ sudo ln -s $PWD/bin/provision /usr/local/bin/pro
```

### Provision Configuration

It will help to read some background on how Provision manages configuration:

1. The `provision` CLI has configuration we call the "console config".  This is configuration that just affects the behavior of the command line tool itself. It can be overwritten by creating a file in your $HOME folder, for example `/home/me/.provision.yml` or `/Users/me/.provision.yml` on a Mac.
2. The Provision console configuration is mostly automatically generated from your system. There are two important settings that you might want to override by creating a `.provision.yml` file: `config`_`path and contexts`_`path`.
3. The `config_path` setting is the parent folder for all others.
   1. If you have a `$HOME/.config` folder \(most desktop OS's do, Mac & Linux included\), the default will be `$HOME/.config/provision`. 
   2. If you don't have a `$HOME/.config` folder, the default will be `$HOME/config`.
4. The `contexts_path` is where the YML files representing your sites and servers are saved. The default contexts path is contexts inside the \`config\_path folder.
5. Each server context gets a folder created for it inside the `config_path`. All configuration for the server goes in this folder, such as Apache configuration.

{% hint style="success" %}
In Provision, sites and servers are called "contexts". You can think of them like Drupal nodes: they are just stored metadata about your server and sites, one file per site and server.
{% endhint %}

You can let Provision use the defaults, or you can create a `.provision.yml` file in your home folder to override these settings like so:

```text
# The default is in .config. This puts it in ~/.provision
config_path: /Users/pat/.provision
contexts_path: /Users/pat/.provision/contexts  
```

When you first run provision, it will check if these folders exist, and if they don't it will automatically run the `setup` command to walk you through creating them.

{% hint style="danger" %}
There is a bug currently where the first time run will throw an error about missing `config_path` folder. We are working on making it run the setup command automatically instead.

Create the `contexts_path` at the default locations to continue:

```bash
$ mkdir $HOME/.config/provision/contexts -p
```
{% endhint %}

Once those links are in place, you can run `provision` or `pro` to view the list of commands.

### Provision Setup command.

Run the provision setup command to get a guided tour and run a setup wizard:

```bash
$ pro setup
                                                                               
  Welcome to the Provision Setup Wizard!                                       
                                                                               

Console Configuration
=====================

 In this section, we will make sure your Provision CLI configuration and       
 folders are created.                                                          

 ! Provision CLI configuration file was not found at /Users/jon/.provision.yml

 Helpful Tips:                                                                 

 ➤ The ~/.provision.yml file determines the config_path and contexts_path settings.
 ➤ The config_path is where Provision stores server configuration. Each server gets a folder inside this path to store their configuration files, such as Apache virtualhosts. The default config path is /Users/jon/.config/provision
 ➤ The contexts_path is where Provision stores the metadata about your servers and sites, called Contexts. Contexts are saved as YML files in this folder. The default contexts path is /Users/jon/.config/provision/contexts
 ➤ When Provision asks you a question, it may provide a [default value]. If you just hit enter, that default value will be used.

 Where would you like Provision to store its configuration? [/Users/jon/.config/provision]:
 > 

 Where would you like Provision to store its contexts? [/Users/jon/.config/provision/contexts]:
 > 

 Would you like to create the file /Users/jon/.provision.yml ? (yes/no) [yes]:

### Provision Save

The provision save command will add sites and servers to the system. It is fully interactive, so you can just type `provision save` to get started. 

You must start with a server, so Provision will help make sure that's the first thing you create. 

Traditionally, the first server we add to Provision is called server\_master, but you can call it whatever you'd like.

{% hint style="info" %}
When Provision asks you a question, it often offers you a \[Default Value\], which will be inside the brackets \[like this\]. If you see this and are happy with that value \(or aren't sure what it means\), just hit _Enter_ and keep moving!
{% endhint %}

So, to create your first server, run the `provision save` command:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="\`\`\`" %}
```text
$ pro save

 Context name [server_master]:
 > 

 Using default option remote_host=localhost
 Using default option script_user=jon
 Using default option aegir_root=/Users/jon
 Using default option server_config_path=
 -------------------- -------------------------------------------- 
  Saving Context:      server_master                               
 -------------------- -------------------------------------------- 
  remote_host          localhost                                   
  script_user          jon                                         
  aegir_root           /Users/jon                                  
  server_config_path   /Users/jon/.config/provision/server_master  
  type                 server                                      
  name                 server_master                               
 -------------------- -------------------------------------------- 

 Save server context server_master to /Users/jon/.config/provision/contexts/server.server_master.yml? (yes/no) [yes]:
 > 

                                                                               
 [OK] Configuration saved to                                                   
      /Users/jon/.config/provision/contexts/server.server_master.yml           
                                                                               

 Add a service? (yes/no) [yes]:
 > 

```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

### Servers & Services

A "server" represents the system providing services to a site, such as "web" and "database".

{% hint style="warning" %}
**NOTE on User Experience: **Currently, you must add services individually to your server context. In the near future, the `setup` command will assess your system and offer pre-configured servers.

Thank you for your patience as we work to make things as streamlined as possible!
{% endhint %}

After the `provision save` command, Pro4 asks if you would like to add services, remember, just hit _Enter_ to answer Yes:

{% hint style="danger" %}
There is currently a bug that requires that the `http` server be added first. Please select "http" as your first service.
{% endhint %}

```text
Add a service? (yes/no) [yes]:

 [OK] Service saved to Context!                                                
                                   
```

### Native vs Docker

Provision works by writing Apache or NGINX configuration and dynamically creating databases.

Provision works on _native_ systems where multiple services are running in a single operating system, like your laptop or a traditional server.

Provision can also work using _docker_ systems where services are run inside Docker containers launched using _Docker Compose. _

The same configuration files are used for _native_ and _docker _systems.

{% hint style="info" %}
To use _Docker_ services, select `httpDocker` and `mysqlDocker` when adding services to your server. Otherwise, Provision assumes your services are running natively.
{% endhint %}

#### Native Services Setup

_Native _services work by linking Provision web server config into your systems Apache or NGINX configuration.

Once you have created a _Server_ context, and added a HTTP service, you will have some a folder and some files created in the `config_path` \(Defaults to `~/.config/provision/$SERVERNAME/apache.conf` or `~/.config/provision/$SERVERNAME/apache.conf`.

Link this file into your host's apache or nginx configuration folders. Every system varies slightly. Edit this command and run it for your system:

```text
# On MacOS:
sudo ln -s /Users/$USER/.config/provision/$SERVERNAME/apache.conf /private/etc/apache2/other/provision.conf
# On Linux (varies by OS)
sudo ln -s /home/$USER/.config/provision/$SERVERNAME/apache.conf /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/provision.conf
$ On Linux with NGINX
sudo ln -s /home/$USER/.config/provision/$SERVERNAME/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/provision.conf
```
